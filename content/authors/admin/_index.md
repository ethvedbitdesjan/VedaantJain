## About Me

I'm an undergraduate at the UIUC, pursuing a degree in Mathematics & Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of trustworthy machine learning, model evaluation, and ML applications in biology. My work includes:

- Quantitative certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Developing humor detection benchmarks for vision models
- Applying diffusion modeling to disease progression simulation

Currently, I'm advancing my work on LLM certification and neural network verification. I'm also venturing into generative modeling for antibody design, leveraging Cryo-EM super-resolution techniques.

My academic pursuits are complemented by practical experience:
- Software (ML) Engineering Intern at Metaphor Data
- Head of Tech at UIUC's Disruption Lab(student run org), leading multiple AI projects and serving clients like AMD.
- Software Developer at UIUC TheorieLearn


I don't just stick to ML – I like to mix things up, so I take a diverse set of courses. For example, Compiler Construction, formal methods, computational social science, and systems programming.

**I'm seeking internship opportunities in machine learning and software engineering for Spring and Summer 2025**. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, please [✉️ reach out via email](mailto:vvjain3@illinois.edu).
