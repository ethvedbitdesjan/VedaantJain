## About Me

I am an undergraduate at UIUC majoring in Mathematics & Computer Science. 
My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, model evaluations, and ML applications in biology. I have contributed to projects on quantitative certification of LLMs, humor detection benchmarks for vision models, and diffusion modeling for disease progression simulation. For more information, please look in Projects page.

Currently, I am contiuing to work on certification in LLMs along with neural network verification. Additionally, I am exploring generative modeling for antibody design using Cryo-EM super-resolution techniques.

I complement my ML research background with software engineering experience, having interned at Metaphor Data and led AI projects in UIUC's student-run Disruption Lab as Head of Tech.

I try to complement my ML experience with diverse coursework spanning compilers, formal methods, computational social science, and systems programming, providing a way to learn.

I am working towards a goal of reliable machine learning that are innovative, reliable, and impactful at scale across domains and industries.
