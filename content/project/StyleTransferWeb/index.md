This project implements artistic style transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Rust. It combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another, creating unique visual outputs. The system is deployed as a web application, allowing users to easily interact with the model through a REST API.

Key features of this project include:
- Implementation of neural style transfer algorithms using Rust bindings for PyTorch
- GPU-accelerated model training for improved performance
- Development of a REST API for seamless integration between the user interface and the server hosting the model
- Web-based interface for users to upload content and style images and receive stylized outputs
